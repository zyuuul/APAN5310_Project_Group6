# APAN5310_Project_Group6
This is for CU course APAN5310 project, we are group 6. This project designs a database for the company SuperTravel.


## Project Description
Our group has decided to work with SuperTravel. We are interested in this scenario due to the
dynamic nature of travel, the opportunity to contribute to a project that will bring incredible
value to this virtual client and also a good practice that we may apply in a real working
environment. Our objective for this group project is to construct a fully normalized and scalable
relational database for SuperTravel that is easily maintainable and enables swift data querying.
By the completion of this project, we anticipate that SuperTravel will be equipped with a
powerful tool that not only enhances their operational efficiency but also drives their decision-
making process through data-driven insights.
